Simon Game
---
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## Gameplay
The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed / clicked. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
